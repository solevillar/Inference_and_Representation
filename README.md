## Syllabus

This is a graduate level course that presents fundamental tools of statistical inference, probabilistic graphical models and generative models for machine learning. 

Some of the covered topics include latent graphical models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Gaussian Processes), state-space models (Kalman Filter, Hidden Markov Models), Gibbs Models and Deep generative models (Variational autoencoders, GANs).

## Recitation (required)
Mondays from 4:55pm-5:45pm, in 100 Washington Sq East, SILV 520.

## Office hours
SV: Tuesdays, 3:00pm-4:45pm. Location: 60 5th ave, 6th floor, room 617.

## Grading
Homework 40%, midterm exam 25%, final project 30%, participation 5%.

## Materials
There is no required book. Assigned readings will come from freely-available online material. 

### Core Materials
  - David MacKay, [Information Theory, Inference and Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf), Cambridge Press, 2003.
  - Kevin Murphy, [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/%7Emurphyk/MLbook/index.html), MIT Press, 2012. You can read this online for free from [NYU Libraries](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/nyulibrary/detail.action?docID=10597102). We recommend the latest (4th) printing, as earlier editions had many typos. You can tell which printing you have as follows: check the inside cover, below the "Library of Congress" information. If it says "10 9 8 ... 4" you've got the (correct) fourth print.
  - Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman, [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://pgm.stanford.edu/), MIT Press, 2009.
  - Mike Jordan's notes on [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/prelims/)
  - [MIT lecture notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-438-algorithms-for-inference-fall-2014/lecture-notes/) on algorithms for inference.
